# Detection-of-Vulnerable-Individuals-Using-NLP-of-Helpline-Records

Psychologists in conventional psychological therapy encourage clients to present their own problems and further change their way of thinking and reacting to real-life scenarios. Psychologists use their language to better prepare clients to positively deal with pain, anxiety, etc. However, there could be extreme and urgent cases that people are overly frustrated, and even have intention to end their life or others’. In response to these enquiries, data scientists created advanced functions which could recognise and respond to their messages immediately. The essential idea is to apply Deep Learning models on clients’ natural language for training classification model to predict those extreme cases. Our model is designed to be a hybrid model that consists of CNN and RNN as well as other important layers. Two neural networks cooperate with each other to accurately recognise vulnerable people. The model achieved desirable ROC-AUC of 96.60%, Recall rate of 79.63% and Precision rate of 30.71%. This study contributes to applying Deep Learning models with Natural Language Processing in psychology.
